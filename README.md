# 💡 Project Ideas

- A basic website to advertise the server and provide verification instructions maybe login in with discord then can link on there
- A web admin dashboard (manage warnings/bans, view registered players, execute server/Discord actions from a button) login with discord
- Integration with an in-game economy system
- Automatic backups of world files
- Admin commands to reset or regenerate world files with new/random seeds (with automatic backup before reset)
- Automatic checks for updated member status and database sync if matched
- Admin commands to reset all member statuses
